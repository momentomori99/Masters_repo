    Compute the multiclass Fisher ratio from reservoir spike feature vectors.

    J = tr(S_B) / tr(S_W)

    S_B: between-class scatter matrix (how far class centroids are from the global mean)
    S_W: within-class scatter matrix (how spread samples are around their class centroid)

    A higher J indicates better class separability in the reservoir representation.

    Args:
        pairs: list of (feature_tensor, label) as returned by framework.run_stimulation()

    Returns:
        J (float): Fisher ratio. Returns 0.0 if S_W trace is zero.
